# Automatic-Attendence-System-using-Opencv
This is an implementation of attendance system using face recognition with the help of OpenCV. Just put some images in the "source images" folder and execute the code. The program will automatically make a list of people/student/employees using the names of the images in source folder. you can also manually create a list of names but that is optional.
